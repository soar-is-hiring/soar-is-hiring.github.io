SOftware Analytics Research (SOAR) Group

> School of Information Systems,

> Singapore Management University (SMU)

Several research engineer/PhD student openings are available in our SOAR research group. Our group works on the application of machine learning, data mining, and information retrieval to help developers code faster, reliably, and securely. We are currently focusing on building effective tools by leveraging software big data that are available in GitHub, StackOverflow, and many other sources. We work closely with several international companies, e.g., Microsoft, Adobe, etc. to solve real industrial challenges. Based on publications in top-tier venues (ICSE, FSE, ASE), CSRankings put SMU at the top 11th position worldwide in the area of Software Engineering.

Our research group has a track record of publishing at top conferences and journals in multiple areas, including software engineering (ICSE, FSE, ASE, TSE, TOSEM), and artificial intelligence (AAAI, IJCAI, KDD, JMLR). The candidates are expected to solve interesting research problems and publish at top conferences or journals. Multiple researchers from the group have successfully became engineers and data scientist at high-tech venues (including Microsoft, Canada; Schroder Investment Management, Luxembourg; Hudson River Trading, Singapore) and tenure-track faculty members at top universities (including University of Melbourne, Australia; Queen's University, Canada; and Monash University, Australia). Our group is diverse with past/current members of the group coming from, e.g., Indonesia, Singapore, China, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Canada, and France.


Interested candidates should send their CV to Associate Professor David Lo (davidlo[at]smu.edu.sg) for more information.
